A minimal game engine, originally written in C when I was learning C, now being rewritten in C++ while I learn C++.

Should work if you build it in Xcode, add libDragonfly.a to an Objective-C++ project and include Dragonfly.h.

Collision detection and physics all written from scratch.

Uses OpenGLES 2.0 and GLKit for rendering.
